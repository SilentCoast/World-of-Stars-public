## Rules and Gameplay of "World of Stars"
**Objective**
The primary objective in "World of Stars" is to conquer all the star systems in a given level. You do this by strategically managing your fleet and capturing enemy star systems.

**Basic Rules**
*Star Systems:* The game board consists of various star systems, each producing ships over time. Star systems can be neutral, controlled by the player, or controlled by enemies.

*Fleet Movement:* Players can send fleets of ships from one star system to another to either reinforce friendly systems or to attack enemy systems.

*Fleet Size:* When you send a fleet, you decide what percentage of ships from a star system to send (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%).

*Combat:* When a fleet arrives at an enemy star system, a battle ensues. The fleet’s ships fight the ships present in the star system. If the attacking fleet outnumbers the defenders, the system is captured.

*Production Rate:* Each star system generates ships over time. More advanced systems might produce ships at a faster rate.

*Map Layout:* Each level has a different map layout, with varying distances between star systems, which affects strategy.

**Strategies for Victory**
*Early Expansion:* At the start of a level, quickly capture nearby neutral systems to increase your ship production capacity. Avoid overextending and leaving your systems undefended.

*Balanced Fleet Distribution:* Always ensure that your star systems have enough ships for defense. Sending 100% of ships might capture a system, but it leaves the original system vulnerable.

*Choke Points and Key Systems:* Identify and control key systems that act as chokepoints or have high ship production rates. Holding these can provide strategic advantages.

*Continuous Pressure:* Keep constant pressure on your opponents. Don’t let them consolidate their forces; attack when they are weak and spread thin.

*Resource Management:* Efficiently manage the ships at your disposal. Overcommitting to an attack can leave you vulnerable, while undercommitting might fail to capture key systems.

*Adaptation and Flexibility:* Adapt your strategy based on the opponent’s actions. Be ready to switch from offense to defense if the situation demands it.

*Use Diversion Tactics:* Send small fleets to attack multiple systems simultaneously to divert the enemy’s attention. This can create openings for capturing more important systems.

*Timing and Coordination:* Time your attacks to hit multiple systems in quick succession. Coordinated strikes can overwhelm the enemy and prevent them from responding effectively.

*Reinforcement Lines:* Establish reinforcement lines where ships can quickly be transferred from one system to another. This ensures that your front-line systems can be reinforced quickly during an enemy attack.

*Surround and Conquer:* Isolate enemy systems by capturing surrounding systems first. This reduces the enemy’s ability to reinforce and makes individual systems easier to conquer.

By mastering these strategies and understanding the rules, players can maximize their chances of victory in "World of Stars". Each level requires a tailored approach based on the specific layout and the behavior of the opponents, ensuring a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.
